# hello_world
"This repository is for practising the GitHub Flow."
Hello there! I'm deeply passionate about delving into the world of coding, especially Python, where I'm honing my skills in backend development, IoT, and open-source projects. Beyond my tech interests, I'm equally captivated by art and culture â€“ you'll often find me immersing myself in museums or getting lost in the magic of an art cinema. For the past four years, I've dedicated myself to lighting design, and recently, I've had the thrill of collaborating as a freelancer with a prolific architect, an experience that's been both exhilarating and fulfilling. Off-duty, I'm all about embracing creativity, discovering new music (though punk and rock hold a special place in my heart), and championing causes that resonate with me. While I'm still on the journey of self-discovery and defining my style, I approach each step with a growth mindset and an eagerness to learn. Let's connect and brainstorm how we can craft something truly extraordinary together, blending professionalism with a dash of personality. I'm eagerly looking forward to it!
